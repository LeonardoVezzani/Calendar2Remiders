To use this app: 
1) install Scriptable on your IOS device
2) create a new script and paste the content of "Calendar2Reminder.js"
You can now run the script by clicking on it in the Scriptable app

If you, like me, want something a bit more user friendly, you can create a shortcut:

1) open "schortcuts" on your device
2) create a new shortcut
3) in the right column search for "scriptable" 
4) select "run script" (usualy second option that pops up) and select Calendar2Reminders and insert NO parameters
5) in the top left corner click on the new script name to rename it, assign an icon and add it to homescreen
6) now place it in a convenient spot (I keep it close to my calendar)

Now everytime I update my calendar i tap on the shortcut and my reminders gets populated with daily tasks.
Enjoy!
